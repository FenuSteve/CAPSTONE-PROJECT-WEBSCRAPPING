# CAPSTONE-PROJECT-WEBSCRAPPING

  Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites. This can be done manually by copying and pasting information from a web page into a spreadsheet, or it can be automated using specialized software tools or programming scripts.

Here's a general overview of how web scraping works:

### Identifying the target website:

Determine which website or web page you want to scrape data from.

### Understanding the structure of the web page: 

Examine the HTML structure of the webpage to understand how the data is organized. You may need to use browser developer tools to inspect the HTML code.

### Selecting the scraping tool or library: 

There are various tools and libraries available for web scraping in different programming languages. Some popular ones include BeautifulSoup (Python), Scrapy (Python), Puppeteer (JavaScript), and Selenium (Python/Java/C#).

### Writing the scraping code: 

Use the selected tool or library to write code that will fetch the HTML content of the webpage and extract the desired data based on the HTML structure. This may involve using CSS selectors, XPath expressions, or other techniques to locate specific elements containing the data you want to scrape.

### Handling dynamic content (if necessary): 

Some websites use JavaScript to dynamically load content after the initial page load. If the data you want is generated dynamically, you may need to use a headless browser automation tool like Selenium or Puppeteer to interact with the page and retrieve the desired data.

### Storing the scraped data: 

Once you've extracted the data, you can store it in a suitable format such as a CSV file, JSON file, or database.

### Respecting website terms of service: 

Before scraping a website, make sure to review its terms of service and robots.txt file to ensure that you're not violating any rules or causing harm to the website.

Handling rate limiting and other restrictions: Some websites may impose rate limits or other restrictions on scraping activity to prevent abuse. Make sure to handle these gracefully in your scraping code to avoid being blocked or banned.
